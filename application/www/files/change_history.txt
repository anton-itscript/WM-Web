- New functionality was added: 
  Moving of old data to backup database

New section "Admin / Setup / DB Export" is available for Admin. 
Here Admin can activate this feature and setup settings for frequency, 
data lifetime and credentials to connect with backup database. 
Backup database can be located at remote server (it must have MySQL server installed)

Once feature is enabled - it will start to move old data in background.
Data is moving by parts - so not all old data can be moved at once.
Also "Admin / Setup / DB Export Log" has been added. Here admin can see brief information about last data moving.

- RG Pages are hide if there are no any RG Stations
- AWS Pages are hide if there are no any AWS Stations
